# 🫀 Predicting 10-Year Risk of Coronary Heart Disease

This project develops a **logistic regression model** to predict an individual’s 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using clinical and lifestyle features. It combines thorough data exploration, model development and interpretability using SHAP to support early detection and preventive care.
